# homebrew-mp

This will include the formulas to use my own versions of [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew) formulas.
__This repository is company internal and will have company specific changes. Watch out.__

If changes to the programs are applicable to the public they will be packaged as pull requests. If not, they get their own formula here for me to use without hard editing code after installing.
